/// The footprint manages snapshots of app memory limits and state,
/// and notifies your app when these change.
///
/// For the longest time, Apple platform engineers have been taught to be careful with memory,
/// and if there is an issue, a notification will tell you when to drop objects and you should be ok.
/// This works well for smaller apps, but as soon as your app grows you start finding that these
/// notifications come too late and with too many restrictions.
///
/// Later came `os_proc_available_memory` which gives us the amount of memory left
/// to our apps before they are terminated. Now we're getting somewhere, we can finally tell if
/// memory was the actual reason for being terminated. But again, we're still missing the upper
/// bound. Say we have 1GB of memory remaining, wouldn't it be useful to know how much
/// we've actually used, wouldn't it be useful to be able to **change the apps behavior based on
/// where our app stands within the bounds of the memory limit**?
///
/// This is where `Footprint` comes in. It gives you the opportunity to handle memory in
/// levels (Footprint.Memory.State) instead of all at once at the end. It expects you to change
/// your apps behavior as your users explore.
///
/// A simple use example is with caches. You could change the maximum cost
/// of said cache based on the `.State`. Say, `.normal` has a 100% multiplier,
///`.warning` is 80%, `.critical` is 50%  and so on. This leads to your
/// caches being purged based on the users behavior and the memory footprint
/// used by your app has a much lower upper bound and much smaller drops.
